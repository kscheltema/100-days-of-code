# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 27, 2022 

**Today's Progress:** Finding out what Firebase guides are depreciated. I went for my third development related interview, getting more used to the terms used. 

**Thoughts:** Good YouTubers and course publishers should remove depreciated guides. Since the time wasted trying to learn depreciated code, or nitpicking depreciated from not. Is like putting on a blindfold and looking for a needle. 

**Link to work:** This is Firebase stuff, so best not public as a whole. So will place the edits. 

+import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
...
+const fireStoreDB = getFirestore(firebaseApp);
...
export {
...
 +fireStoreDB,
 
 added & removed due to depreciated guide:

### Day 2: June 28, 2022 
**Today's Progress:** I got a return on a console.log from firestore

**Thoughts:** credit to (CRUD Tutorial Using React + Firebase | Firebase 9 and Firestore Tutorial), I am having difficulty remembering how and where to apply key. 

**Link to work:** The commits was trashed, so redit yesterdays commits. 
... I played around with styling based on this Page Component. I saw bugs so removed the code and made a not for a new branch. 

import * as React from "react";

import { firestoreDB } from "../firebase-config";

import { collection, getDocs } from "@firebase/firestore";

const BlogDetail = () => {

  const [blogItem, setBlogItem] = React.useState([]);
  
  const blogListRef = collection(firestoreDB, "blog_list");
  

  React.useEffect(() => {
  
    const getBlogItem = async () => {
    
      const dataFB = await getDocs(blogListRef);
      
      console.log("This is Firebase", dataFB);
      
    };

    getBlogItem();
    
  }, [blogListRef]);
  

  return <div></div>;
  
};
